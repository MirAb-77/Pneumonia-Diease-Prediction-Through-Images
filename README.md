# **Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-rays**

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based solution to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, the system classifies X-rays into two categories: Normal and Pneumonia.  
**Dataset**: [Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

---

## **Project Highlights**
1. Built a CNN model for binary classification (Normal vs Pneumonia).  
2. Preprocessed and augmented the dataset to improve model robustness.  
3. Achieved significant accuracy in detecting pneumonia cases.  
4. Developed a web application for user-friendly diagnosis visualization.

## **Web Application**
A web-based interface was developed using **Flask**/**Streamlit** to provide users with an intuitive experience for:  
- Uploading chest X-ray images.  
- Viewing classification results (Normal or Pneumonia).  
- Downloading predictions as reports.
